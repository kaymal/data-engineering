    "### Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways. The two main types of modern databases are relational and non-relational, also known as SQL or NoSQL(for their query languages). SQL databases are known as relational databases, and have a table-based data structure, with a strict, predefined schema required. NoSQL databases, or non-relational databases, can be document based, graph databases, key-value pairs, or wide-column stores. NoSQL databases don’t require any predefined schema, allowing you to work more freely with “unstructured data.” Relational databases are vertically scalable, but usually more expensive, whereas the horizontal scaling nature of NoSQL databases is more cost efficient. Unlike traditional, SQL based, relational databases, NoSQL databases can store and process data in real-time. [ref](https://www.mongodb.com/scale/nosql-vs-relational-databases)\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored. For example, data may be stored as simple key/value pairs, as JSON documents, or as a graph consisting of edges and vertices.

    "#### Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a finite directed graph with no directed cycles. That is, it consists of finitely many vertices and edges (also called arcs), with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that there is no way to start at any vertex v and follow a consistently-directed sequence of edges that eventually loops back to v again.

    "#### Apache Airflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Airflow (or simply _Airflow_) is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The airflow scheduler executes the tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Airflow, a pipeline is represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph or DAG. The nodes of the graph represent tasks that are executed. The directed connections between nodes represent dependencies between the tasks. Representing a data pipeline as a DAG makes much sense, as some tasks need to finish before others can start.
